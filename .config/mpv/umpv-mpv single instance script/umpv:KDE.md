## Setting umpv as Default Video Player in KDE Plasma

1. **Open the KDE System Settings:**
   - You can usually find it in your application launcher or by searching for "System Settings."

2. **Navigate to the "Applications" Section:**
   - Look for and select "File Associations" from the left sidebar.

3. **Filter File Types:**
   - In the "File Associations" window, type "video" into the search bar to filter the list of file types.

4. **Select "video" or "video/*" Entry:**
   - Look for the entry named "video" or "video/*" in the list. Click on it to select it.

5. **Edit mpv Association:**
   - In the right-hand pane, find the entry associated with "mpv" and click on it.

6. **Add umpv:**
   - To the right of the list, find and click the "Add" or "Add..." button.

7. **Search and Select umpv:**
   - In the dialog that appears, type "umpv" into the search bar.
   - Select "umpv" from the list of applications and click "Add" or "OK."

8. **Set umpv as Default:**
   - If needed, move "umpv" to the top of the list to set it as the default application. Use the "Move Up" button until it's at the top.

9. **Save Changes:**
   - Click "Apply" or "OK" to save your changes.

Now, when you double-click on a video file, it should open with umpv instead of mpv. Keep in mind that these instructions are general, and the exact steps may vary slightly depending on your version of KDE Plasma.
