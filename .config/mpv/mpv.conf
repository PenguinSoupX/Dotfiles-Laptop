# Specify the graphics API to use for GPU acceleration
# Vulkan is a low-level graphics API that provides high-performance access to the GPU

# Set the scaling algorithm to "ewa_lanczossharp"
# This is a high-quality scaling algorithm that uses elliptical weighted average filtering and Lanczos resampling
# to produce sharp, detailed images
scale=ewa_lanczossharp

# Set the chroma scaling algorithm to "ewa_lanczossharp"
# This is the same algorithm used for the luminance scaling
cscale=ewa_lanczossharp

# Set the downscaling algorithm to "mitchell"
# This is a high-quality algorithm that produces smooth, detailed images
dscale=mitchell

# Enable frame interpolation
# This generates new frames between existing frames to smooth out motion and reduce judder

# Set the temporal scaling algorithm to "catmull_rom"
# This is a high-quality algorithm that generates smooth, detailed motion between frames

# Set the video synchronization method to "display-resample"
# This resamples the video to match the display refresh rate and eliminates judder and tearing
video-sync=display-resample

# Set the anti-ringing filter strength to 0.5
# This reduces the artifacts that can occur during image scaling
